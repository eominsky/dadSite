            <div class="title">Personal Injury</div>
                <p>Personal injuries include injuries to the body, mind or emotions, as opposed to an injury to property.  Common types of personal injury claims arise from motor vehicle accidents, bus accidents, slip and fall, premises liability, accidents at work, assault claims, and accidents in the home. We have a long history of obtaining monetary compensation for our clients who have suffered serious personal injuries due to the negligence or carelessness of others. In Pennsylvania, we strongly recommend that our clients purchase “Full Tort” insurance coverage for their motor vehicles including uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage so they do  not inadverently give up  valuable legal rights and remedies.</p>

        <div class="practicesItem">
            <div class="title">Medical Malpractice</div>
                <p>Medical malpractice occurs when a person suffers injury due to the negligent act or omission of a health care provider. Common instances of medical malpractice cases include the failure by a health care provider to follow standard procedures, properly diagnose a medical condition (for example, failure to diagnose cancer), properly perform a surgical procedure, and to prevent injury at birth. When a lawsuit alleges negligent injury causing death, it is a wrongful death case.</p>

            <div class="title">Wills and Estates</div>
                <p>Our firm has significant experience preparing wills, living wills, trusts and powers of attorney.  To be enforceable, a will must meet certain legal requirements and be properly witnessed and executed.  A living will provides direction in the event you become incapacitated and unable to communicate your wishes with regard to the nature and extent of the medical care you wish to receive.   A person does not have to be wealthy to have preparations made in the event of his or her incapacity or death.</p>

        <div class="practicesItem">
            <div class="title">Product Liability</div>
                <p>Product liability claims typically involve personal injury claims that are caused by a defective or dangerous product or device.  A manufacturer has a duty to make its product safe for the intended use, provide adequate instructions and give proper warnings to prevent avoidable injuries and accidents.  Our firm has successfully prosecuted product liablility claims against major corporations and suppliers of dangerous and defective products including motor vehicles, power tools and equipment, medical devices, pharmaceutical drugs and household items.</p>

        <div class="practicesItem">
            <div class="title">Bankruptcy</div>
                <p>Bankruptcy law provides for the development of a plan that allows a debtor, who is unable to pay his creditors, to resolve his debts by dividing his assets among his creditors. Certain bankruptcy proceedings allow a debtor to stay in business and use revenue generated to resolve his or her debts. The main purpose of bankruptcy law is to allow certain debtors to free themselves of the financial obligations they have accumulated, after their assets are distributed, even if their debts have not been paid in full.  Our firm is experienced representing both creditors and debtors in the United States Bankruptcy Courts.</p>

        <div class="practicesItem">
            <div class="title">Real Estate Law</div>
                <p>Real estate refers to land, as well as anything permanently attached to the land, such as buildings and other structures. Both federal and state laws regulate real estate transactions. These state and federal laws encompass everything from ownership of land and buildings to related issues such as financing, leasing, construction, taxes and environmental laws. Our practice includes representing buyers and sellers in real estate transactions, as well as landlords and tenants.  We strongly recommend all homeowners purchase homeowners insurance for their properties and that renters purchase renter’s insurance to both protect their property and provide coverage for potential liability in the event someone is injured on your property.</p>
